Are you building an ML model/autonomous system or a human-in-the-loop/decision support system

1. Lowest level - Operational [ML/Autonomous, easier to automate optimal decision, lower uncertainty, clear goals, strong assumptions not clear, alternatives are obvious]
2. Mid-level - Tactical 
3. High-level - Strategy [Decision support, hard to automate, high uncertainty, unclear goals, assumption sensitivity is important, alternatives not obvious]
