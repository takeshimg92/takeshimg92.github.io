![A picture of a happy man enjoying a tasting of sake (2022)](/assets/images/sake.jpg)

I enjoy, in this order:

* Korean food;
* Good sushi (some no frills places in São Paulo are in [this list](https://goo.gl/maps/UN1xBUHNq2rjaka99));
* Izakayas;
* Karaoke;
* Machine learning;
* Probability theory;
* Language learning;
* Anything physics-related.

When not eating, I can also be seen studying data science. I also lead the data science teams at the Experian DataLabs in São Paulo, Brazil.

In previous iterations, I was a management consultant and data scientist at the Boston Consulting Group. I was also a Masters student in Theoretical Physics, focusing on classical general relativity.
