I can be seen in my natural habitat enjoying things like

* Korean food;
* Good sushi (some no frills places in São Paulo are in [this list](https://goo.gl/maps/UN1xBUHNq2rjaka99));
* Izakayas;
* Karaoke;
* Machine learning;
* Probability theory;
* Language learning - currently struggling with making sure I don't forget Japanese while I learn Mandarin;
* Anything physics-related.

I also lead the data science teams at the Experian DataLabs in São Paulo, Brazil.

In previous iterations, I was a management consultant and data scientist at the Boston Consulting Group, working in Brazil and Japan.

I did my Masters in Theoretical Physics at the [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/), focusing on classical general relativity. 
I also took the *cycle ingénieur polytechnicien* at the [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), which is a fancy way to see I have a bachelor's/master's in Engineering and Physics despite not being able to build many things. 
My bachelor's degree was in Physics at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/).
